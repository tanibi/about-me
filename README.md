## About

This repo will be used to share my information with the rest of the class and to share some useful resources to aid in web development.

## Recommended Tools

To publish a repo with GitHub pages the first thing you need is to create an account in [GitHub](https://github.com/) if you don't have one already. Then you can follow the steps below:
1. You need to create a new repository and you can do that by either clicking on the plus icon or your profile icon at the top right corner of your page and initialize with a README.md.
2. And then, you can go to setting of your newly created repo by clicking on the gear icon and then go to GitHub Pages and enable it by clicking "master branch" option under source. Doing this will automatically generate a link to your hosted site that you can share it with friends or for other purposes.

Also, you need to know some basic [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to edit README file. 

## Recommended Resources

Since I have very little knowledge and experience in web development, I don't have any links to recommend per se. However, I found some links on the internet whih could be a great place to start for beginners like me.
