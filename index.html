    <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>I am from Nepal and I graduated high school from Little Angels' School. 
I don't have a lot of experience with web page designing or application 
development but I am familiar with the basic groundwork. I pursued my career 
in CS hoping to expand my knowledge in technology. As for my interest I like 
creating new things or exploring new ideas.</p></section>

    <h2>Aside</h2>
        I am really not sure about my future plans but at the moment I am excited 
about two of my courses this semester, one being Web Apps and the other Android. 
I am hoping these two courses might help me narrow down my area of interest 
for I am interested in creating and designing. I like reading books and writing a 
few paragraphs. Here's my link to my LinkedIn profile:
