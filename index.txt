I am a Computer Science major and I will be graduating in Fall 2020.

I am from Nepal and I graduated high school from Little Angels' School. I don't have a lot of experience with web page designing or application development but I am familiar with the basic groundwork. I pursued my career in CS hoping to expand my knowledge in technology. As for my interest I like creating new things or exploring new ideas.

I am really not sure about my future plans but at the moment I am excited about two of my courses this semester, one being Web Apps and the other Android. I am hoping these two courses might help me narrow down my area of interest for I am interested in creating and designing.

I like reading books and writing a few paragraphs. Here's my link to my LinkedIn profile:
